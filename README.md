### Model 1: Estimation of R<sub>0</sub>
- Purpose
  * Estimate the value of basic reproduction number
- Usage
  * Download my Jupyter notebook file: [Estimation of R0.ipynb](https://github.com/yijunwang0805/YijunWang/blob/master/Estimation%20of%20R0_Yijun/Estimation%20of%20R0.ipynb).
  
  * ```R0Func()``` is the function that calculates the basic reproduction number. Its ```inputs``` are the number of ```confirm``` cases, the number of ```suspect``` cases, and days ```t``` since the start of the epidemic. Here, we use the December 1st, 2019 as the start of the epidemic, which is the first nCoV case reported. 

- Summary
  * This study seeks to estimate the basic reproduction number by deriving R<sub>0</sub> from the SEIR model. As of 2020-02-14, R<sub>0</sub> is estimated to be 2.41.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  lambda is the growth rate of estimated infectious

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  rho is the ratio of latent period over generation period.
  
### Model 2: Forecasting Using SEIR model
- Purpose
  * Forecast the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic peak time in metropolis by applying a deterministic SEIR metapopulation transmission model
- Usage
  * Download my Jupyter notebook file: [SEIR.ipynb](https://github.com/yijunwang0805/YijunWang/blob/master/SEIR%20Forecast_Yijun%20Wang%20%26%20Owen%20Xu/SEIR.ipynb).
  
  * ```R0Func()``` is the function that calculates the newest basic reproduction number given up to date statistics. Its ```inputs``` are the number of ```confirm``` cases, the number of ```suspect``` cases, and days ```t``` since the start of the epidemic. Here, we use the December 1st, 2019 as the start of the epidemic, which is the first nCoV case reported. 
  * ```SEIR()``` is the epidemic model that describes the system of differential equations.
  * ```betaFunc()``` and ```gammaFunc()``` calculate the value of transmissibility and removal rate, respectively.
  * ```spi.odeint()``` solves the system of differential equations. Its ```inputs``` are the epidemic model ```SEIR()```, initial value of susceptible, exposed, infectious, removal ```INI```, and the number of days since the epidemic ```Time```
  * Please note the **several assumptions** will limit the use of this model, for instance, assumption of consistent behaviors before and during the epidemic means that people do **not** implement social or non-pharmaceutical intervention.
- Summary
  * This study seeks to forecast the peak time of SARS-CoV-2 cases. We find, under the assumptions of no quaratine intervention, Wuhan reach peak infection March 3, 2020; Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou would each peak infection in the middle of May. 
  * Sensitivity analysis shows that reducing half of the number of catchment size and the reproductive number would reduce the magnitude of epidemic by more than 60%, while lengthening the peak to June and duration of the epidemic to August.
- Model
  * A typical **SEIR** (susceptible, exposed, infectious, removed) model can be described as a system of differential equations
